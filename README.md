# Search-Engine
Search Engine in Python


Note: This search engine is currently incomplete/not working 100%, but has enough code that you can view the following.

1). There is a scraper using the Scrapy framework. It currently uses BFS to scrape news pages off of the web.
2). There is an index file that indexes all of the pages and builds an inverted index for all of the words.
3). There is a file that computes Pagerank and a file that computes TF-IDF.
4). There is a file that runs the whole program in start.py and combines the TF-IDF and Pagerank scores
5). The cgi file can be ignored as it never worked. Will be replaced by some sort of Django interface later.
