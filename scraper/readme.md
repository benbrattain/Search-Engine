Instructions:

This branch solely exists to implement mapreduce of pagerank. As such, this is a much more barebones file. The pages directory is a copy of the ones you handed out for a4 as they are guaranteed to cause less problems. index.py is a copy from the main branch so it does have unnecessary computations in that file such as invindex.

To run type in your terminal "python mapreducepagerank.py"
